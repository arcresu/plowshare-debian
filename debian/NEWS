plowshare (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This version of plowshare includes a new tool, plowmod, for manual management
  of modules. You may choose to use this tool instead of or alongside the
  plowshare-modules package, but note that it will result in the execution of
  arbitrary code downloaded from the Internet. See README.Debian for details.

  This version also adds support for user modules which can be installed at

      ~/.config/plowshare/modules.d/MODULE_NAME.sh

  so that you can test new modules. Consider contributing them upstream!

plowshare (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Upstream has split the plowshare modules into a separate repository and has
  decided not to maintain them as carefully as before. A new package called
  plowshare-modules will package snapshots of this new repository:

      https://github.com/mcrapet/plowshare-modules-legacy

  There will be a tool included with future versions of plowshare to help with
  manually updating a local copy of the scripts, which you can do instead of
  using this new package if you want faster updates.

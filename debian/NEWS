plowshare (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Upstream has split the plowshare modules into a separate repository and has
  decided not to maintain them as carefully as before. A new package called
  plowshare-modules will package snapshots of this new repository:
  https://github.com/mcrapet/plowshare-modules-legacy
  There will be a tool included with future versions of plowshare to help with
  manually updating a local copy of the scripts, which you can do instead of
  using this new package if you want faster updates.

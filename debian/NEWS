plowshare (2.1.2-1~bpo8+1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This package now contains only the framework for writing script to
  communicate with file host rather than supporting any of those hosts
  directly with included modules.

  This version of plowshare includes a new tool, plowmod, for management
  of modules. It downloads the set of modules from the upstream repository
  on GitHub. Be warned that using these modules amounts to executing
  arbitrary code from the Internet. See README.Debian for details.

  This version also adds support for user modules which can be installed at

      ~/.config/plowshare/modules.d/MODULE_NAME.sh

  so that you can test new modules. Consider contributing them upstream!

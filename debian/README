Plowshare includes a tool, plowmod, which lets you manually update the modules.
You have three choices of how to manage modules:

  1) Ignore plowmod and instead rely on plowshare-modules, which may become out
     of date, but is maintained as a debian package and receives updates
     through the normal packaging tools.

  2) Install plowshare-modules but also use the plowmod tool. Using this tool
     will result in the execution of arbitrary shell scripts downloaded from
     the Internet. The only advantages are that you receive updates to broken
     modules sooner, and you can track additional upstream repositories.

     The first time you run this tool, you will be asked to execute:

         plowmod --install

     which will create a local copy of the upstream modules repository. You may
     also use the tool to install additional repositories:

         plowmod --install https://github.com/example/plowshare-module-xxx.git

     and to update them all with:

         plowmod --update

     The versions of the scripts installed by this tool will take priority
     over any installed through the plowshare-modules package.

  3) Uninstall plowshare-modules and exclusively use plowmod.
